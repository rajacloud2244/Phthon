Introduction

Python applications often rely on third-party packages that may not be compatible across different applications.
Conflicts can arise when one application needs a specific version of a library that differs from another application's needs.
Virtual environments provide a solution by allowing you to create isolated environments for different applications, each with its own dependencies.


Managing Packages with pip
pip is the package installer for Python, used to install, upgrade, and remove packages.
To install the latest version of a package:
python -m pip install package_name==version_number
