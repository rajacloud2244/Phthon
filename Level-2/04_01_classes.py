What Are Classes?
Classes are like blueprints for creating objects (think of them as a recipe).
They bundle data (attributes) and functions (methods) together.
How to Define a Class
You define a class using the class keyword. Hereâ€™s a basic structure:


Attributes and Methods
Attributes: These are variables that hold data related to the class. Each object can have its own unique values for these attributes.
Methods: These are functions defined within the class that describe the behaviors or actions of the objects created from the class.

Types of Attributes
Instance Attributes: These are attributes specific to an instance of a class. Each object can have different values for these attributes.

Class Attributes: These are attributes shared across all instances of a class. They have the same value for every instance.
